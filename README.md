# Doc-ConnectHealthcare

### Project Objective

Implement core OOP principles to design a specific functionality of a Healthcare Application for patient management.

### Core Functionality

- Doctor Availability Management

    Doctors must be able to input their availabilities, specifying a date. This application assumes that if a doctor marks their availability on a specific date, the availability will be set for the doctor from 5 pm to 10 pm on that day by default.
- Appointment Slots

    2 types of appointments can be arranged which are general and referral. Referral appointments 
    take additional data from the doctor who made the referral and referral notes.

    Appointment slots will be fixed at 1-hour intervals.
  
    Based on the number of slots booked for the day, the time of the appointment would be 
    dynamically calculated.
  
- Patient Booking

    Patients will select a doctor and a desired appointment date.
    The system will display the available slots for all the doctors on the chosen date.
    Patients can book an available slot. The system must prevent multiple bookings for the same 
    slot.
- Slot Time Calculation

    The system will present a list of all registered doctors.
    Doctors will have the ability to view a list of their patients scheduled for a specific date.
  
- Doctor and Patient Information

    The system will present a list of all registered doctors.
    Doctors will have the ability to view a list of their patients scheduled for a specific date.
